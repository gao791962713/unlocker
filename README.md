# macOS Unlocker V4 for VMware Workstation

---
**IMPORTANT**
---
1. Use a release from the releases section of this GitHub repository. https://github.com/DrDonk/golocker/releases
2. Always uninstall the previous version of the Unlocker before using a new version or
   running an update on the VMware software. Failure to do this could render VMware unusable.
3. You use this software at your own risk and there are no guarantees this will work
   in future versions of VMware Workstation.

## 1. Introduction
Unlocker 4 is designed for VMware Workstation and Player 16 and has been tested against:

* Workstation Pro 16 on Windows and Linux
* Workstation Player 16 on Windows and Linux

The Unlocker enables certain flags and data tables that are required to see the macOS type when setting
the guest OS type, and modify the implmentation of the virtual SMC controller device. These capabiltiites are normally 
exposed in Fusion and ESXi when running on Apple hardware.

The patch code carries out the following modifications dependent on the product being patched:

* Fix vmware-vmx and derivatives to allow macOS to boot
* Fix vmwarebase.dll or libvmwarebase.so to allow Apple guests to be selected during VM creation
* Provide a copy of the macOS VMware Tools for the guest

It is important to understand that the Unlocker cannot add any new capabilities to VMware Workstation and Player
but enables support for macOS that is disabled in the VMware products that do not run on Apple Hardware.

The Unlocker cannot:

* add support for new versions of macOS
* add paravirtualized Apple GPU support 
* add AMD CPU support

or any other features that are not already in the VMware compiled code. 

A patched macSO kernel must be used to run on AMD systems.

## 2. Prerequisites
The code has no pre-requisites and should run directly from the download. The code is written in Go with some 
utility Bash and Powershell files.

## 3. Windows
On Windows you will need to either run a Command or Powershell prompt as Administrator and navigate to the folder
where the golocker has been unpacked and run:

```
   cd .\windows
   .\unlocker.exe <install | uninstall>
   install - install patches
   uninstall - uninstall patches
```
## 4. Linux
On Linux you will need to be either root or use sudo to run the scripts in the terminal and navigate to the folder
where the golocker has been unpacked and run:

```
   cd ./linux
   ./unlocker <install | uninstall>
   install - install patches
   uninstall - uninstall patches
```

## 5. VMware Downloads
These URLs will link to the latest versions of VMware's hosted products:

* VMware Fusion https://vmware.com/go/getfusion
* VMware Workstation for Windows https://www.vmware.com/go/getworkstation-win
* VMware Workstation for Linux https://www.vmware.com/go/getworkstation-linux
* VMware Player for Windows https://www.vmware.com/go/getplayer-win
* VMware Player for Linux https://www.vmware.com/go/getplayer-linux

## 6. VMware Tools
The Unlocker provides the VMware tools ISO images. There can be newer releases available which can be downloaded
from these URLs if the script has not yet been updated:

* Mac OS X 10.5 - 10.10 https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/details?downloadGroup=VMTOOLS10012&productId=491
* macOS 10.11+ https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_tools/11_x

_These URLs require a VMware login to download._

Version 16 of Workstation Pro recognises the darwin.iso files and the tools can be installed in the usual way by
using the "Install VMware Tools" menu item. The Player version does not automatically pick up the ISO images and so
the ISO must be maually attached to the VM via the guest's settings.

## 9. Thanks
Thanks to Zenith432 for originally building the C++ Unlocker and Mac Son of Knife
(MSoK) for all the testing and support.

Thanks also to Sam B for finding the solution for ESXi 6 and helping me with
debugging expertise. Sam also wrote the code for patching ESXi ELF files and
modified the Unlocker code to run on Python 3 in the ESXi 6.5 environment.
